# Surgical mask detection

I wrote a machine learning project that deals with surgical mask recognition based on wav audio files. For implementing this task I used **Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (mfcc)** and **Logistical regression.**

# Why mfcc and logistical regression

**Mel-frequency cepstrum** is a representation of the short-term power spectrum of a sound, based on a linear cosine transform of a log power spectrum on a nonlinear mel scale of frequency, it's very often used in speech recognition because of how similar it is to the way humans process sounds.
**Logistical regression** is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable. It is a simple model in it's nature and is especially useful in classifying data in a binary way, reason why it works well for this task.
